# Demystifying the Schema.org Universe: A Guide to All Its Types

Schema.org, a collaborative effort between major search engines like Google, Bing, and Yandex, offers a rich vocabulary for structuring web content. This vocabulary, expressed through various schema types, helps search engines understand the meaning and context of your webpage, potentially leading to richer search results and enhanced user experiences. But with over 800 schema types in existence, navigating this vast landscape can be daunting. Fear not, intrepid explorer! This guide will serve as your map to understanding the diverse and fascinating world of Schema.org types.

## Broad Schema Categories:

- **Entity Types:** These represent real-world objects or concepts, like Person, Organization, Place, Event, and Product. Imagine each type as a building block, forming the foundation of your structured data.

- **Property Types:** These define specific attributes or characteristics of entity types. For example, name, description, url, price, and rating are all property types associated with the Product entity. Think of them as paintbrushes, adding details and depth to your entity blocks.
